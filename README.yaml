description: |-
  Generates cloud-init user data for a Tor server (relay or bridge) using the latest stable Debian release. It
  *may* also work with Debian derivatives but has not been tested with anything other than Debian. You may want to
  check out the [sr2c/torrc](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sr2c/torrc/) and
  [sr2c/contactinfo](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sr2c/contactinfo) modules for generating
  torrc configuration files and
  [ContactInfo Information Sharing Specification](https://nusenu.github.io/ContactInfo-Information-Sharing-Specification/)
  lines respectively.
  
  The tor package will be installed from the official Tor Project Debian repository at deb.torproject.org. The signing
  key for the repository is included in this module.
  
  The `obfs4proxy` and `nyx` packages can be installed by setting the respective inputs. For obfs4proxy, an apt
  preference file is installed to always enable the use of stable backports. This will only work on Debian and on
  other derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu) an older version of obfs4proxy would be installed from the available repositories.
  Additional packages may also be installed using the `additional_packages` input.
  
  The configuration will also change the default congestion control algorithm to BBR as it has been observed to perform
  better in many of the scenarios where Tor is used. If this is really a problem then please submit an issue and it
  could be made optional.
